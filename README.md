# GPU course - project using parallel programming on CPU and on GPU

The task at hand was to create the Conway Game of Life on CPU parallel and then on GPU. OpenCL was used with NVIDIA GTX 1050Ti.

## CPU Conway Game of Life

CPU version of the Game of Life. Parallel and sequential as well. In the parallel version there's time measurement to get the difference in computing time. To run the code, simply download, compile and run with "\.vscode\build\ConwayCPU.exe".

## GPU Conway Game of Life

GPU version of the Game of Life. Used OpenCL for NVIDIA card. To run the code, simply download, compile and run with "\.vscode\build\OpenCL-CPP-Conway.exe"
